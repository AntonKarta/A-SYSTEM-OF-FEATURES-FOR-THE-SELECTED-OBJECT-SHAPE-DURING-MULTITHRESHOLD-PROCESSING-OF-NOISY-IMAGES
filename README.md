# A-SYSTEM-OF-FEATURES-FOR-THE-SELECTED-OBJECT-SHAPE-DURING-MULTITHRESHOLD-PROCESSING-OF-NOISY-IMAGES
Purpose of the work: search and selection of a system of features of the shape of objects, a selectable object in multi-threshold image processing, to solve problems: 1. adaptive setting of the selection threshold; 2. classification of the selected objects according to the form. A laptop with the Windows 10 operating system was used as a development tool. In the process of work, a package of applied programs for solving problems of technical calculations MATLAB version 2020a. This package is used to solve a wide range of scientific problems of any complexity.â€ƒ
